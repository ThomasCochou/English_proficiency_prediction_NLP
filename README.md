The aim of this task is to predict someone's English proficiency based on a text input.

Using the The NICT JLE Corpus available here : https://alaginrc.nict.go.jp/nict_jle/index_E.html

The source of the corpus data is the transcripts of the audio-recorded speech samples of 1,281 participants (1.2 million words, 300 hours in total) of English oral proficiency interview test. Each participant got a SST (Standard Speaking Test) score between 1 (low proficiency) and 9 (high proficiency) based on this test.

The goal is to build a machine learning algorithm for predicting the SST score of each participant based on their transcript.
